# Cricket_Match_Runs_Predictor
In this project, a Machine Learning (ML) model was developed to predict a target variable based on a given dataset. The project was executed using Python programming language and various libraries for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Data Preprocessing:
The raw dataset was loaded into the Python environment using the Pandas library. The data was then processed to handle missing values, perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and convert data types as needed. Outliers and duplicates were also addressed to ensure the dataset's quality and integrity.

Model Selection and Evaluation:
The project involved the use of 12 popular supervised ML algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, MLP Regressor, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, AdaBoost Regressor, and Bagging Regressor. Each algorithm was trained and evaluated on the dataset using the R-squared (R2) score and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as performance metrics. Additionally, cross-validation was employed to assess the models' generalization capability.

Model Training and Validation:
The KNeighborsRegressor algorithm emerged as the best-performing model with an R2 score of 0.93 and an MSE of 0.05 on the test data. The model demonstrated a high capability to explain the variance in the target variable and had a relatively low mean squared error, indicating its accuracy in predicting the target values. Cross-validation results further confirmed the model's robustness and consistency with a cross-validated R2 score of 0.94 and a cross-validated MSE of 0.04.

GitHub Repository:
The project's code, data, and documentation were organized and version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub. The repository includes Jupyter Notebooks detailing the data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation processes. Markdown files provide clear and comprehensive explanations of each step, making it easy for others to understand and replicate the project.

The GitHub repository serves as a collaborative platform for sharing the ML model, enabling other developers and data scientists to access, review, and contribute to the project. It fosters transparency, facilitates collaboration, and encourages the community to provide feedback and suggestions for further improvement.

In conclusion, the project successfully developed and evaluated a KNeighborsRegressor model to predict the target variable. The GitHub repository promotes open-source practices, allowing for knowledge sharing, peer review, and ongoing enhancement. By making the project publicly accessible, it contributes to the broader data science community, fostering collective learning and advancing ML techniques.
